## Conventions

- replace `projects` with your actual projects directory
- replace `git_repository_url` with your actual git repository url

## Initialization

We suggest updating pip to the latest version and using a virtual environment to wrap all your libraries.

### Virtual environment

**IMPORTANT**: Please, create an empty virtual environment, with the right python version, and activate it.
To install and use virtualenv, please, visit the official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

### Requirements

[Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) must be installed before initializing the project.

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ pip install -U invoke
```

## Git

#### Git initialization

In order to initialize git and sync the project with an existing repository:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ cd ~/projects/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv gitinit git_repository_url
```

#### Git clone

To get the existing project, change directory, clone the project repository and enter the newly created **{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}** directory:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ cd ~/projects/
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ git clone GIT_REPOSITORY_URL {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
```

**NOTE** : Make sure you switch to the correct branch (e.g. `git checkout develop`)

#### Git hooks

To install pre-commit into your git hooks run the below command. pre-commit will now run on every commit. Every time you clone a project using pre-commit running pre-commit install should always be the first thing you do.

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ pre-commit install
```


## Quickstart

Invoke init and follow instructions, to configure the project:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv init
```

## Libraries

### List outdated libraries

To list all outdated installed libraries:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ pip list -o
```

### Update libraries

Edit the appropriate .ini requirements file, to add/remove pinned libraries or modify their versions.

To update the compiled requirements files (`requirements/*.txt`), execute:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ make pip
```

Alternatively, in order to update specific dependent libraries to the latest version (e.g. urllib3), execute:
ï¿¼
```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ make pip p='-P urllib3'
```

### Install libraries

To install the just updated requirements (e.g. `requirements/dev.txt`), execute:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ make dev
```

## Testing

To run the full test suite, with coverage calculation, execute:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ make test
```

## Static files

To collect static files, execute:

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ make collectstatic
```

## Continuous Integration

Depending on the CI tool, you might need to configure Django environment variables.

### Gitlab CI

The configuration file `.gitlab-ci.yml` should work as is, needing no further customization.

## Database

### Create

To create a local database (database settings from `.env`):

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv createdb
```

### Drop

To drop the local database (database settings from `.env`):

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv dropdb
```

### Reset

To reset database execute (database settings from `.env`):

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv dropdb
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv createdb
```

**NOTE**: Beware all data will be lost.

### Dump

To dump the local database into `deploy/dump.sql.bz2` (database settings from `.env`):

```shell
({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) $ inv dumpdb
```
